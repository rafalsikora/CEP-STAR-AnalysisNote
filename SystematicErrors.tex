\chapter{Systematic uncertainties}\label{chap:systematicErrors}

\section{Discussion of systematic effects}\label{sec:systEffectsList}
The following contributions to the overall systematic uncertainty have been studied. Influence of each systematic effect on measured cross sections has been tested by changing amount of the quantity that the systematic effect refers to and comparing the result with that obtained using nominal values.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Representativeness of the embedding sample.}\\
 Zero-bias data available for the MC embedding is only a fraction of all zero-bias triggers, therefore physics data may be not fully represented in MC events used for determination of the TPC track reconstruction efficiency. This effect was studied by comparing estimated average levels of pile-up in the data and embedded MC. The difference was found to be of the order of 1\%, which we establish as a symmetric systematic uncertainty on the TPC track reconstruction efficiency (per track). See the last paragraph of Sec.~10.1.1 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote} for more details.
 %
 \item \textbf{Embedding procedure/off-time pile-up effect.}\\
 Reliability and precision of the embedding technique was verified and quantitatively estimated in the procedure described in Sec.~10.1.1 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}. Embedded MC samples were divided into sub-samples representing different levels of off-time pile-up/densitity of hit points in TPC. With dedicated analysis it was possible to verify if the TPC track reconstruction efficiency is compatible between all sub-samples when the effect of pile-up (changing number of hits forming a track) is reduced. The average systematic uncertainty related to the embedding procedure is $<1\%$ (per track, Fig.~10.5 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}). 
 %
 \item \textbf{Modelling of the dead material in front of the TPC.}\\
 Not all detector elements are fully modeled in the MC simulation, quite often some simplifications are used. This leads to inaccuracies in efiiciencies derived from the simulation. We estimated systematic uncertainty related to amount of simulated material between the primary vertex and STAR TPC to be 25\% which translates to $\approx 0.5\%$ of uncertainty of the TPC track reconstruction efficiency. See Chap.~9 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote} for details.
 %
 \item \textbf{Modelling of the TOF system and validity of derived efficiency corrections.}\\
 The efficiency of matching TOF hits with the TPC tracks has been extracted from embedded MC sample. It has been confronted with TOF efficiency extracted from the data using two independent techniques: tag\&probe (Sec.~4.1 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}) and HFT-tagging (Sec.~10.2.2 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}). Average difference between the data and MC efficiency has been used as a correction to MC efficiency, while half of the difference between data-extracted efficiencies has been treated as a systematic uncertainty (Fig.~10.16, Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}). This amounts 1\%-3\% (per track), depending on particle species.
%
 \item \textbf{Modelling of the RP system and validity of derived efficiency corrections.}
 Reliability of RP simulation which was used to extract efficiency corrections with MC embedded into zero-bias data, has been verified and quantitatively estimated in the procedure described in Sec.~10.3 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}. For this purpose elastic proton-proton scattering events have been used. The same analysis has been performed on embedded elastic scattering MC and the data, leading to estimates of the RP acceptance and track reconstruction efficiency. The differences between two results has been considered as a measure of the systematic uncertainty that covers RP track reconstrucion efficiency itself, detectors alignment, embedding technique.
 %
 \item \textbf{Longitudinal shape and position of the primary vertex distribution.}\\
 Comparison of the $z_{\text{vtx}}$ distribution as seen in the TPC and in RPs leads to conservative estimate of the uncertainty of central position of the vertex equal 2~cm, and the spread (standard deviation) of vertex equal 3~cm.
 %
 \item \textbf{Luminosity determination.}\\
 Uncertainty of the integrated luminosity has been estimated to 7\%, which is still subject to change.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Graphical representations of systematic uncertainties}
In the remaining part of this chapter we present relative contributions of effects listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:systEffectsList} to the total systematic uncertainties on differential fiducial cross sections presented in Chap.~\ref{chap:physicsResults}. Numbering of figures is preserved with respect to corresponding cross section results in the next chapter. The color code is the same in all figures, with the legend explaining the meaning of each color attached at the bottom of Fig.~\ref{systematics_01}.

% Sharp drops of the measured cross sections at $m(\pi^+\pi^-) < 0.6$~GeV and at $m(K^+K^-) < 1.3$~GeV for the $\Delta\phi>$ 90 degree range are due to the fiducial cuts applied to the forward scattered protons. 
% %
% In case of the cross section for CEP of $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs in $\Delta\phi<90$ degree range the peak around $f_2(1270)$ resonance in data is significantly suppressed while the peak at $f_0(980)$ is enhanced as well as possible resonances in the mass range $1.3-1.5$ MeV compared to the $\Delta\phi>90$ degrees range.

% Such correlation between resonances seen in mass spectrum and azimuthal angle between outgoing protons indicates factorization breaking between the two proton vertices.

% \noindent
% Figure~\ref{systematics_4} shows the differential cross sections for CEP of different particle species pairs as a function of the pair rapidity (left column), of the difference of forward protons azimuthal angles (middle column) and of the sum of squares of the four-momenta transfers at the proton vertices (right column), for the three invariant mass ranges. In the case of the cross section $d\sigma/dy$ all models agree in shape with data in all three mass ranges except for the GenEx and DiMe predictions in the highest mass range where predictions is narrower.
% 
% Strong suppression of the fiducial cross section close to $90^\circ$ is due to the STAR RP acceptance while asymmetry $0^\circ$ vs. $180^\circ$ in the lowest mass region is due to the STAR TPC acceptance. $\Delta\phi$ distribution is sensitive to absorption  which are treated fully differentialy in DiMe generator and only on average in GenEx. This is consistent with generally better agreement between data and DiMe expectations except $f_2(1270)$ mass region. MBR model predicts symmetric $\Delta\phi$ distributions in all mass ranges which is not supported by the data.
% 
% The slope of the cross section as the function of $|t_1+t_2|$ is less steep in the $f_2(1270)$ mass region compared to other mass regions. In the low mass region the DiMe prediction has steeper slope compared to data.\\

% We have also studied angular distributions of the charged particles produced in the final state. This can be done in various reference frames. However, for an easy comparison with theoretical predictions we use here the Collins-Soper \cite{cs_frame} reference frame also used e.g. in Ref.~\cite{lebiedowicz_3}. Collins-Soper frame is the centre-of-mass frame of the charged particles pair with the $z$-axis making equal angles with the beam protons momenta which in addition define the new $x-z$ plane. It can be reached from the laboratory frame (proton-proton c.m.s.) in two steps. First, boost along the $z$-axis to an intermediate frame in which the pair longitudinal momentum is equal to zero. In this frame the beam protons momenta remain parallel to the $z$-axis and the transverse momentum of the pair remains unchanged. Second, boost in the direction of the transverse momentum of the pair, to get to the pair c.m.s. frame.
