\section{Trigger}\label{seq:trigger}

Presented analysis made use of data taken in 2015 during $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$~GeV. The main trigger designed for studies of Central Diffraction in run 15 was RP\_CPT2. It was formed of the following conditions combined by logical AND (\&\&):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{(ET \&\& !IT) $||$ (!ET \&\& IT)} = signal in at least one RP on each side of the STAR central detector - to ensure presence of two forward-scattered protons; a veto was imposed on simultaneous signal in RPs above and below the beamline, which might have originated either from proton dissociation, or pile-up event, or beam halo proton etc.,\\[-15pt]
 \item \textbf{!BBCE \&\& !BBCW \&\& !ZDCE \&\& !ZDCW} = veto on any signal in small BBC tiles or ZDCs on any side of STAR central detector - such requirement is in accordance with the double-gap topology of CEP events, it mostly filtered out CEP events with parallel pile-up event(s),\\[-15pt]
 \item \textbf{TOF$\geq$2} = at least 2 hits in TOF - aim of this condition was to ensure activity in the mid-rapidity; since the lowest multiplicity allowed in CEP is 2, that was the lower threshold of L0 TOF multiplicity.
\end{enumerate}%
This trigger was running with an average prescale of 5 and average DAQ rate of 250~Hz, which allowed to collect in total about 560~M events corresponding to 16.5~pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.  More information about number of events per run, rates etc. can be found under link provided in Ref.~\cite{onlineRpTriggersMonitoring}, which contains selected data from STAR run log~\cite{RunLog}. Luminosity data used in this analysis comes from Ref.~\cite{Luminosity}.

All RP triggers which were intended for usage in diffractive physics analyses or efficiency studies are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:triggers}. Components used in definitions of these triggers are outlined in Fig.~\ref{fig:triggerBits}. Detailed explanation of all trigger bits can be found in Refs.~\cite{RpTriggers,RpTriggers2}. Explanation of naming convention in Roman Pot system can be found in Ref.~\cite{Labeling}.

\section{Reconstruction software}\label{sec:recoSoftware}

Raw data was processed with STAR libraries in versions SL17f. All four trigger datasets were processed: production\_pp200trans\_2015, production\_pp200long2\_2015, production\_pp200long3\_2015 and production\_pp200long\_2015 (see~\cite{ProductionList}).

The following BFC options were used in the reconstruction:\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{verbatim}
DbV20160418,pp2015c,btof,mtd,mtdCalib,pp2pp,-beamline,beamline3D,useBTOFmatchOnly,VFStoreX,
fmsDat,fmsPoint,fpsDat,BEmcChkStat,-evout,CorrX,OSpaceZ2,OGridLeak3D,-hitfilt
\end{verbatim}
Main attention should be put on option \textbf{useBTOFmatchOnly} which forced vertexing algorithm to form vertices only from the global TPC tracks which are matched with hits in the TOF system. This solution was found to yield significantly larger signal reconstruction efficiency (vertexing efficiency) and better resolutions. The study which lead to above conclusions, presented in Ref.~\cite{RevertexingProposal}, was performed on the same dataset processed with older libraries SL15k (without useBTOFmatchOnly option).



\section{Data format}\label{sec:dataFormat}

The analyzed data was stored in ROOT files in the picoDST format which was in large part a skimmed MuDST (standard STAR format). The picoDST format was introduced in Ref.~\cite{PicoDstDescription}. PicoDST description files (C++ headers etc.) can be found in the analysis code repository~\cite{AnalysisCodeRepo}.
