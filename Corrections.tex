\section{Acceptances and efficiencies}

In this section we present calculation of all efficiencies except TPC track reconstruction and TOF hit reconstruction and matching efficiency, which were discussed and presented in Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}.

\subsection{Trigger efficiency}\label{sec:triggerEff} 


\subsubsection{Online TOF efficiency}\label{sec:tofOnlineEff}
The efficiency of the part of the trigger related to TOF subsystem $\mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}_{\text{TOF}}^{\text{trig}}$ was calculated using the zero-bias data. Events with exactly 1 TOF vertex (cut~\ref{enum:CutPrimVx}), exactly 2 primary good quality TOF-matched TPC tracks (cuts~\ref{enum:TpcTofMatched}, \ref{enum:TpcQualityCuts}) and maximally 3 TOF clusters (cut~\ref{enum:CutTofClusters}) were used to calculate this efficiency defined as a probability of having at least two TOF hits on the trigger level in selected set of events:

\begin{equation}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}_{\text{TOF}}^{\text{trig}} = \frac{\text{\#events with $\geq2$ L0 TOF multiplicity and 1 TOF vtx and 2 TOF trks and $\leq3$ TOF cltrs}}{\text{\#events with 1 TOF vtx and 2 TOF trks and $\leq3$ TOF cltrs}}
\end{equation}

}
\end{figure}
%---------------------------

It has been verified that described efficiency does not depend on the transverse momentum of two tracks. In Fig.~\ref{fig:tofTrigEff2} we show dependence of the TOF trigger efficiency in one dimension, as a function of lower $p_{T}$ of two TOF-matched tracks. Data points are consistent with constant value, herefore a single number for this efficiency is used, equal to 98.7\%. It is important to account for the fact that at some point of data-taking (see Tab.~\ref{tab:triggers}) an upper limit ($<10$) on L0 TOF multiplicity was imposed. Study shows that with the cut on offline TOF cluster multiplicity (cut~\ref{enum:CutTofClusters}) the efficiency of the trigger with and without upper limit of online TOF multiplicity remains unchanged, so the same value of the efficiency is used for the entire dataset.



\subsubsection{Online veto (BBC-small and ZDC veto)}\label{sec:onlineVetoEff}

Vetoeing signal in BBC-small and ZDC detectors on both sides of STAR was implemented in the logic of RP\_CPT2 trigger. Common correction of the online and offline vetoes which is used in the correction procedure explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:correctionProcedure} is presented in. Sec.~\ref{sec:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff}. However, to help quantifiy effect of just the online vetoes in BBC-small and ZDCs we show the Fig.~\ref{fig:onlineVetoEff} with the efficiency of the joint BBC-small and ZDC veto as a function of the instantaneous luminosity calculated from the zero-bias data. Details of the way the efficiency was calculated as well as description of the data in the Figure is the same as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff}.

\subsubsection{RP triggering efficiency}\label{sec:rpTrigEff}

Based on preliminary studies preformed during data taking using fast offline data (MuDst) we concluded that the RP triggering efficiency is very close to 100~\% and eventual correction (which is going to be evaluated) is much smaller than overall systematic uncertainty. For the time being we assume that
\begin{equation}
\mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}\left(\TRE\land\TRW\right) =  \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}\left(\TRW\right) \times \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}\left(\TRE\right) = 1.

\subsubsection{Up and Down RP combination veto (due to dead material)}\label{sec:rpDeadMat}

Probability that secondaries induced by proton with successfully reconstructed and selected RP track generate a trigger signal in the other RP branch on the same side was calculated using the embedded MC (see Sec.~6.3 in Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote} for details of RP simulation in Geant4). Forward protons from CEP process provided by GenEx~\cite{GenEx} were simultaneously generated from the interaction point spatially distributed the same as in the data. MC samples for all runs with RP\_CPT2 triggers were produced to account for non-constant positions of the RP detectors throughout the run 15. Number of simulated events for each run was proportional to number of RP\_CPT2 triggers in given run. The angular divergence of the beams was also simulated.

The discussed probability, $\mathcal{P}_{\text{DM~veto}}^{\text{side}}$, was calculated as a probability that a MC-trigger signal is present in the branch on given side other than east and west branches where primary forward protons are expected from their initial momenta, under condition that these east and west branches detect a MC-trigger signal and there is no veto due to simultaneous ET\&IT trigger bits in the overlayed data (no pile-up veto). By MC-trigger we understand the trigger signal reconstructed solely from the simulated data (not from the data embedded into).

Technically the $\mathcal{P}_{\text{DM~veto}}^{\text{side}}$ was obtained in the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No simultaneous ET\&IT trigger bits were allowed in the data of an event that simulated signal was embedded into.
	\item It was verified if there are MC-trigger signals in east and west branches that the primary forward protons were expected to reach based on their $p_{y}$ ($p_{y}>0$ - branch UP, $p_{y}<0$ - branch DOWN). These events formed $set~A$.
	\item Events with the MC-trigger signal in RP branch other than the branch with MC-trigger signal expected from proton $p_{y}$ on given side formed $set~B$.
	\item The probability was determined by the ratio of histograms from $set~B$ and $set~A$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:rpDeadMatProb}
	\begin{split}
 \mathcal{P}_{\text{DM~veto}}^{\text{side}}(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}}) = \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}^{\text{side}}\left(\Vdm\left|!\Vpu\land\TRE\land\TRW\right.\right) = ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ =%
 \frac{(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}})~\text{histogram for protons from}~set~B}{(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}})~\text{histogram for protons from}~set~A}
 \end{split}
  \end{equation}
	
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that the momentum components $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ were taken from the proton with accounted effect of the beam divergence (after the original initial momentum smearing). Sample probability of a dead-material-induced veto is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sampleRpDeadMatVeto}, with all the remaining results contained in Appendix~\ref{appendix:rpEff}.

The efficiency of the discussed veto which is finally used to correct the data is opposite of the veto probability, namely
\begin{equation}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{DM~veto}}^{\text{side}} = 1 - \mathcal{P}_{\text{DM~veto}}^{\text{side}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reconstruction and selection efficiency}\label{sec:cutsEff}
\subsubsection{TPC \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z}-vertex cut~(\ref{enum:CutZVx})}

Removing from analysis specific range of $z$-positions of primary vertices effectively reduces accepted luminosity with respect to that delivered by the collider. This loss of luminosity has to be accounted when calculating the cross sections, which is the goal of presented analysis. Assuming that the distribution of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ of all primary interactions that take place when east and west beams overlap follows a normal distribution ($\mathcal{N}$), then the formula describing efficiency of the cut~\ref{enum:CutZVx} has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zVtxCutEff}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{z_{\text{vtx}}} = \int\limits_{z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{min}}}^{z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{max}}} \mathcal{N}(z_{\text{vtx}}; \mu, \sigma)~\text{d}z_{\text{vtx}} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \text{Erf}\left(\frac{z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{max}} - \mu}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right) - \text{Erf}\left(\frac{z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{min}} - \mu}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right) \right],
\end{equation}
where $z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{min}}$ and $z_{\text{vtx}}^{\text{max}}$ are respectively minimum and maximum value of the longitudinal position of the vertex accepted in analysis (in our case these are -80~cm and 80~cm), and parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are respectively the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution:
\[\mu = \langle z_{\text{vtx}}\rangle,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\sigma = \sigma(z_{\text{vtx}}).\]

Real parameters of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ distribution were studied separately for every single fill of the collider. It is motivated by the fact that each fill of the machine is nearly independent from the previous thus the shape and position of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ may vary on fill by fill basis. We neglect possible changes within the fill (e.g. widening of the distribution due to intrabeam scattering etc.) arguing that this effect if expected to be smaller than the systematic uncertainties related to determination of position and width of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ distribution.

For every fill of RHIC the distribution of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ of single TOF vertices was prepared, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sampleZVtxHist}. This distribution was fitted with the Gaussian function in a range $z_{\text{vtx}}\in[-120~\text{cm}, 120~\text{cm}]$. The output parameters of all fits were plotted as a function of the fill number, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:zVxMeanAndSigmaVsFillNumber}. The efficiency used in the correction procedure was calculated independetly for each fill using presented values of $\langle z_{\text{vtx}}\rangle$ and $\sigma(z_{\text{vtx}})$. Typical numerical value of this efficiency equals $\sim88\%$.

\subsubsection{TPC-RP \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z}-vertex matching~(\ref{enum:CutDeltaZVx})}
\subsubsection{Primary vertices limit~(\ref{enum:CutPrimVx}), BBC-large veto~(\ref{enum:CutBbcLarge}), TOF clusters limit~(\ref{enum:CutTofClusters}) and Up and Down RP combination veto (due to pile-up)}\label{sec:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff}

Combined efficiency of the online veto in BBC-small and ZDC (Sec.~\ref{sec:onlineVetoEff}) and offline cuts (vetoes) on extra TPC-TOF vertices, extra TOF clusters, signal in BBC-large and simultaneous signal in Up and Down RPs, was calculated using the zero-bias data. For each run a fraction of events (for colliding bunches) was calculated in which all mentioned cuts would be satisfied in case of the CEP $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$/$K^{+}K^{-}$/$p\bar{p}$ event (event would not be vetoed). One can tranform this prescription to simple formula below:

\begin{equation}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}^{\text{veto}}_{b_{E}b_{W}}=\dfrac{\splitdfrac{~~~~~\text{\#events in the run without TOF vertices, without signal in BBC-S, BBC-L, ZDC,}}{\text{RP branches other than} ~b_{E},~b_{W},~\text{and with no more than 1 reconstructed TOF cluster}}}{\text{\#events in the run}}
\end{equation}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff} this efficiency is presented as a function instantaneous luminosity delivered by the machine, for each combination of east and west RP branches. Result for each combination is nearly identical as the effect of ET\&IT trigger veto in RPs is not dominant, as well as trigger in all branches had similar acceptance. The data points were fitted with the exponential function (of the form containted in the figure) which reflects the fact that this efficiency should behave similar to the probability of lack of any interaction in the bunch crossing given by the Poisson distribution:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:poisson}
 \text{Pois}(0;\mu) = \frac{\mu^{0}}{0!} \times e^{-\mu} = e^{-\mu}.
\end{equation}
Comparison of the $\mu$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:poisson} with the fit parameters in Fig.~\ref{fig:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff} leads to approximate determination of the average interaction probability per bunch crossing equal $0.2-0.9$. The result of the fit, $ \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}^{\text{veto}}_{b_{E}b_{W}}(\mathcal{L})$, is finally used to correct measured data as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:correctionProcedure}. 

Comparison of efficiencies in Fig.~\ref{fig:onlineAndOfflineVetoEff} with similar efficiency in Fig.~\ref{fig:onlineVetoEff} demonstrates that offline selection has much smaller impact on the loss of signal events than online selection. It has to be underlined that online vetoes were necessary to set trigger purity to satisfactory level, as well as reduce prescale of the trigger.

\subsubsection{Missing \texorpdfstring{$p_{\text{T}}$}{pT} cut~(\ref{enum:CutMissingPt})}

The resolution of the total transverse momentum is in general determined by the angular divergence of the proton beams. This angular divergence is connected with imperfect collimation of the beams - protons do not circulate in RHIC along a single closed line, they rather move within certain volume\footnote{In other words, their phase-space during orbitation is not point-like, it is elliptic. The area of this elliptic phase space is called emittance. The lower the emittance is, the better collimation of the beam is and lower transverse size of the beam is.}. Based on known parameters of the beams in run 15 (see Ref.~\cite{run15Overview}) expected divergence for a single beam (and single transverse spatial coordinate) amounts 180~$\mu$rad. In forward proton track reconstruction the direction of the incoming proton is assumed to be the same in each event (aligned with nominal $z$-axis), hence effectively the transverse components of reconstructed forward protons momenta are smeared by this amount. One can check the comparison of the collinerities of elastically scattered protons in the data and embedded MC (Fig.~10.19 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}) to see the satisfactory agreement between the two with assumed MC divergence equal to 180~$\mu$rad. For 100~GeV beam such divergence results in smearing of the tranverse momentum components for (elastically) scattered protons equal $100~\text{GeV}\times 180\cdot 10^{-6} = 18~\text{MeV}$. Using this value to calculate the resolution of total $p_{x}$($p_{y}$) momentum of two forward protons we get $\sqrt{2}\times 18~\text{MeV} = 25.5~\text{MeV}$. One can compare it with the output of fits to distributions of  $p_{x}^{\text{miss}}$($p_{y}^{\text{miss}}$) and find that indeed the angular beam divergence dominates the resolution of the total transverse momentum in CEP events. 

There is, however, another ingredient to the total transverse momentum resolution, namely the momentum resolution of the central tracks, whose significance rises up together with increasing track $p_{\text{T}}$. Most of CEP events is characterized by low invariant mass of the central tracks pair ($\lesssim 1.5$~GeV) which is inextricably linked with low momentum of tracks ($\lesssim 0.7$~GeV), therefore an effect of $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ widening is barely visible in the missing momentum distribution integrated over mass (e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:MissingPxPy}). Nevertheless one can calculate the efficiency of the exclusivity cut as a function of the central tracks momenta to directly see this effect.

Physics model of the CEP process from GenEx was used in embedded signal MC, therefore there was no sufficient statistics (too low population of high-$p_{\text{T}}$ tracks) to calculate the efficiency of $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ cut as a function of central tracks momenta. In such case the efficiency of this cut was calculated using simplified MC method described below.

A simple CEP event generator was used to produce large sample of CEP events (kinematics of protons and pions) in the fiducial phase space of the measurement. For each event the hadronic level momenta of positive and negative central tracks were smeared according to resolution function obtained from the embedded MC (6~MeV if $p_{\text{T}}<0.3$~GeV, $2.4~\text{MeV} + 1.2\%\times p_{\text{T}}$ if $p_{\text{T}}>0.3$~GeV). Next, the $p_{x}^{\text{miss}}$ and $p_{y}^{\text{miss}}$ were calculated from these smeared pions momenta and hadronic level forward protons momenta. Both $p_{x}^{\text{miss}}$ and $p_{y}^{\text{miss}}$ were added the Gaussian component corresponding to the experimental resolution extracted in Figs.~\ref{fig:MissingPxPy}a and~\ref{fig:MissingPxPy}b (means and standard deviations printed in the plots were used). At the end, $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ was calculated with the use of Eq.~\eqref{eq:missingPt}. The efficiency of the exclusivity cut was defined as a following ratio:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ptMissCutEff}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}}(p^{\text{max}}, p^{\text{min}}) = \frac{N_{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}}(p^{\text{max}}, p^{\text{min}})}{N_{\text{all}}(p^{\text{max}}, p^{\text{min}})},
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{all}}$ is a number of all generated CEP events and $N_{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}} $ is number of events passing exclusivity cut \ref{enum:CutMissingPt}. The result if shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ptmisscuteff}. The cut efficiency for very low tracks momenta (low pair invariant mass) obtained from simple MC (96.8\%) agrees perfectly with the efficiency calculated using embedded MC sample for the same momenta range (96.4\%), which validates presented efficiency. Clearly, the deterioration of the central track momentum resolution starts to play significant role in efficiency of $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ cut at about 1~GeV track momentum.

\subsubsection{Particle identification~(\ref{enum:CutPid})}\label{sec:pidEff}

Correction reflecting efficiency of identification requires good modeling of detector response in terms of $dE/dx$ and TOF time ($\rightarrow m^{2}_{\text{TOF}}$) measurement which were used for this purpose as described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:pidCuts}. In addition to this, significant number of simulated events is needed to reduce statistical uncertainties of efficiency. The former was provided by adjusting $dE/dx$ spectra from embedded MC to match the data, as elaborated in Chap.~7 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}. The latter, however, was not easy to achieve for exclusive $K^{+}K^{-}$ and $p\bar{p}$ whose identification is most challenging and information about identification efficiency is the most needed among studied species. Specially for study of particle (exlusive pair) identification a dedicated MC simulation was prepared.

This dedicated MC simulation was designed to work as follows (simulation of single CEP event of predefined pair ID is described):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The position of $z_{\text{vtx}}$ was drawn from predefined distribution.
 \item Kinematics of central state particles was set: momentum (magnitude) $p$, pseudorapidity $\eta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ of positive and negative charge particles were drawn from predefined distributions.
 \item Both particles were tested if doubled radius of curvature $2R$ of associated track in the magnetic field of the TPC ($B=0.5$~T, $R \propto p_{\text{T}}/B$) is smaller than the radius of TOF detector barell (assumed 212~cm). If not then event was skipped and procedure was restared (back to 1.).
 \item The particles were propagated from the vertex at $(0,0,z_{\text{vtx}})$ through the magnetic field of TPC using Newton's method with the time step (in the laboratory) equal 100~ps, corresponding to space step $<3$~cm.
 \item After step 4. the position of the TOF cell was known allowing to calculate the TOF path length $L$ between the vertex and position of the TOF hit. Also the TOF hit time $t$ was then known, further smeared by adding random number from normal distribution with mean at 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_{\text{TOF}}=100$~ps to account for the finite TOF time resolution. In addition to this, reconstructed tracks' (transverse) momenta were defined as the true momenta smeared by 6~MeV if $p_{\text{T}}<0.3$~GeV or by $2.4~\text{MeV} + 1.2\%\times p_{\text{T}}$ if $p_{\text{T}}>0.3$~GeV, to account for finite TPC momentum resolution. At this stage it was possible to calculate $m^{2}_{\text{TOF}}$ using Eq.~\eqref{eq:mSquared}.
 \item The $dE/dx$ measurement was simulated. For each particle a $dE/dx$ was drawn from the distribution of the form given by Eq.~(7.6) and of parameters (for given particle ID and momentum) which were extracted from the data and tabulated in Tab.~7.1, all contained in Chap.~7 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}. This assured that the simulated $dE/dx$ exactly matched the data. Once $dE/dx$ for both particles (tracks) was obtained, value of the $dE/dx$ error (more strictly: uncertainty of $\ln(dE/dx~[\text{keV/cm}])$) and $\log_{2}(dx)$ was also set up. These quantities depend on the number of TPC hit points used in the reconstruction of $dE/dx$ (the more hits in tracks, the better resolution of $dE/dx$ and higher $dx$), which obviously is not accessible without full STAR simulation in Geant. This problem was solved by extracting dependence of $\sigma(\ln(dE/dx))$ and $\log_{2}(dx)$ on the TOF path length from the data (from CEP events, Fig.~\ref{fig:correlationsTofPathLength}). Since the length of the TOF path is very strongly correlated with the number of hits forming the track and thus number of hits used to reconstruct $dE/dx$, one is allowed to draw $\sigma(\ln(dE/dx))$ and $\log_{2}(dx)$ from their distributions for particular TOF path lengths calculated in 5. and use as measured ones. In this way the simulation preserves relevant connections between $dE/dx$-related quantities. After these steps are taken the $n\sigma_{X}$ ($X=\pi$, $K$, $p$) variables are calculated for each track using the definition, in exactly the same way as it is done during standard data reconstruction.
 \item Event information needed to study pair identification was stored in the ROOT tree: ID of particles forming a pair, their three-momenta, $m^{2}_{\text{TOF}}$, $n\sigma_{\pi}$, $n\sigma_{K}$ and $n\sigma_{p}$.

For the purpose of determination of pair identification efficiency in CEP analysis descibed in this note, parameters of vertex distribution were set to match the data: $\langle z_{\text{vtx}}\rangle=0$ and $\sigma(z_{\text{vtx}})=50$~cm, as well as $z_{\text{vtx}}$ was required to lie within the analysis limits (cut~\ref{enum:CutZVx}). Distribution of particle $\eta$ was set to flat and limited to analyzed range $|\eta|<0.7$, while particle $\phi$ was defined as uniformly distributed in full azimuth ($2\pi$~rad), both fairly agreeing with expectations from physics models and observations in data.

The identification efficiency/misidentification probability was studied in two dimensions - as a function of particles' momenta. Because of that the shape of momentum distribution for PID efficiency study was not required to match the data and was defined flat, spanning between $0.2$~GeV and 3~GeV, to provide low statistical uncertainties over full momentum space. We considered particles' momenta as the best quantities to study pair identification because $n\sigma_{X}$ and $m^{2}_{\text{TOF}}$ and their resolutions depend nearly solely on magnitude of momentum.

The cuts (\ref{enum:CutPidPtLimits}) are $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{min}}>0.7$~GeV for kaons and $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{min}}>1.1$~GeV for protons, indicated with dashed blue lines and arrows.

\subsection{RP track acceptance and reconstruction efficiency}\label{sec:rpAccAndEff}

To calculate RP acceptance and track reconstruction efficiency the embedded MC technique was used. The same sample was used as that described in Sec.~\ref{sec:rpDeadMat}, used for calculation of the dead-material related trigger veto.

The joint RP acceptance and track reconstruction efficiency for a given STAR side, $\mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{RP}}^{\text{side}}$, was calculated as a probability that a single good quality RP track (satisfying cuts~\ref{enum:RpQualityCuts}-\ref{enum:RpLocalAngles}) matched with true-level primary forward proton is reconstructed on given side in the branch expected based on sign of $p_{y}$ of the proton, under condition that there is a trigger signal in that branch and there is no trigger signal in the other branch on the same side.

Technically the $\mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{RP}}^{\text{side}}$ was obtained in the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It was verified if there is a trigger signal in the branch that the primary forward proton is expected to reach based on its $p_{y}$ ($p_{y}>0$ - branch UP, $p_{y}<0$ - branch DOWN). Additionally required lack of trigger signal in the other branch on the same side. These events formed $set~A$.
	\item The nominal RP track selection algorithm was used to find a single good quality track (cuts~\ref{enum:RpQualityCuts}-\ref{enum:RpLocalAngles}) on given side. If exactly one such track was found, it was additionally checked if it is matched with true-level primary proton. These events formed $set~B$.
	\item The efficiency was determined by the ratio of histograms from $set~B$ and $set~A$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:rpEffDef}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{RP}}^{\text{side}}(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}}) = \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}\left(\RPSIDE\left|\TRSIDE\land~!\TRNSIDE\right.\right) = %
 \frac{(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}})~\text{histogram for protons from}~set~B}{(p_{x}, p_{y}, z_{\text{vtx}})~\text{histogram for protons from}~set~A}
  \end{equation}
	
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that the momentum components $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ were taken from the proton with accounted effect of the beam divergence (after the original initial momentum smearing).

%---------------------------


The efficiency calculated in the way described above is, by design, the acceptance, reconstruction and selection efficiency for a single proton on one side of the IP. In CEP event there are two independent forward protons which may be simultaneously not reconstructed or rejected by the selection algorithm due to e.g. elastic pile-up interaction providing additional good quality proton tracks on both sides of IP. One could, in principle, calculate 5-dimensional efficiency for both forward protons (in variables $p_{x}^{\text{E}}, p_{y}^{\text{E}}, p_{x}^{\text{W}}, p_{y}^{\text{W}}$ and $z_{\text{vtx}}$) which would ultimately account for the simultaneous east and west inefficiency, however this would require orders of magnitude larger statistics of MC to provide reasonably low statistical uncertainty of the efficiency. Instead, on top of the 3-dimensional reconstruction and selection efficiencies for east and west RPs we calculate (from embedded MC) probability that the proton tracks are simultaneously not reconstructed or selected on the east and west side, despite the trigger signal solely in expected RP branches (no trigger veto) and true-level $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ of both forward protons contained in the fiducial region. This probability, denoted as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{\text{E\&W}}_{\text{loss}} = \mbox{\LARGE$\varepsilon$}\left(!\RPE\land~!\RPW\Big|\TRE\land\TRW\land~!\V\Big.\right),
\end{equation}
 is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:SimultaneousEastWestRpTrackLoss} for all four comibnations of east and west RP branches.





\subsection{TPC vertex reconstruction efficiency}\label{sec:tpcVxRecoEff}

%---------------------------

  \includegraphics[width=0.365\textwidth]{graphics/corrections/deltaZ0Definition2.pdf}
  \caption[Sketch with definition of $\Delta z_{0}$.]
   {Sketch with definition of the longitudinal separation of two tracks (helices) $\Delta z_{0}$.}
   \label{fig:deltaZ0Sketch}\vspace*{-9pt} 
\end{wrapfigure}
%---------------------------

The definition of vertex reconstruction efficiency ($\mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{vtx}}$) established in this analysis is the probability that two global tracks, both associated with true-level primary particles from the kinematic region of the measurement, both satisfying kinematic and quality criteria (cuts~\ref{enum:TpcKinematicCuts} and ~\ref{enum:TpcQualityCuts}) and both matched with hits in TOF, form a vertex listed in the collection of reconstructed primary vertices and DCA(R) and DCA(z) of both global tracks calculated w.r.t. this vertex is contained within the limits of cut~\ref{enum:TpcDcaCuts}.

We calculated this efficiency as a function of the longitudinal separation between two tracks (global helices) $\Delta z_{0}$. Illustration of this quantity is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaZ0Sketch}. We consider this a natural quantity to present the vertexing efficiency - the closer to each other the helices are on the beamline, the more probable it is that two tracks will form a common primary vertex. It is in accordance with the way the vertexing algorithm works.


The vertexing efficiency was calculated from the data in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data from RP\_CPT2 trigger were used. Events were selected with nearly the same cuts as in nominal CEP analysis (Sec.~\ref{sec:listOfCuts}). The requirement of exactly one primary vertex with exactly two primary TOF tracks was dropped. Instead, analysis utilized only global TOF tracks - exactly two global TOF tracks were required (cut~\ref{enum:TpcTofMatched} without primary track requirement), passing also cuts~\ref{enum:TpcOppoSign}-\ref{enum:TpcQualityCuts}. In this case the position of the vertex was reconstructed as\vspace*{-10pt}
\begin{equation}
 z_{\text{vtx}} = \frac{z_{0}^{+}+z_{0}^{-}}{2},\vspace*{-5pt}
\end{equation}
where $z_{0}^{+}$ and $z_{0}^{-}$ are longitudinal impact parameters ($z$-coordinates of points of closest approach to the beamline) of positive and negative charge particle tracks, respectively. The vertex position was normally required to satisfy cut~\ref{enum:CutZVx}. Events after full selection, classified as exclusive $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ candidates, formed $set~A$.

\item The two global TOF tracks were checked if they have associated primary tracks, and the two primary tracks are assigned to the same primary vertex. If yes, the tracks were additionally subjected to cut~\ref{enum:TpcDcaCuts}. Events passing descibed selection formed $set~B$.

	\item The efficiency was determined by the ratio of histograms from $set~B$ and $set~A$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:vertexingEffDef}
 \mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{vtx}}(|\Delta z_{0}|) = \frac{|\Delta z_{0}|~\text{histogram for events from}~set~B}{|\Delta z_{0}|~\text{histogram for events from}~set~A}.
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

Distribution of $|\Delta z_{0}|$ between two CEP global track candidates after full selection ($set A$) is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaZ0}. The vertexing efficiency obtained with described method is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexingEff}. Solid green points represent efficiency calculated with the non-exclusive background preserved, while open black points represent efficiency with this background subtracted (using method described in Sec.~\ref{sec:bkgdSubtraction}). Since the vertexing efficiency does not depend on the physics process and background is purely of physics origin the black and green points should overlap. Such picture emerges from presented comparison. We have calculated the same efficiency using CEP MC embedded into zero-bias data, the result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexingEff} with red points. There is very good agreement between vertexing efficiency in the data and embedded MC for $|\Delta z_{0}|<1$~cm, where most ($\sim80\%$) of the signal is present. The differences in high-$|\Delta z_{0}|$ tail are understood as a result of the imperfect description of the pointing resolution (here: the transverse resolution) of TPC tracks in STARsim. Although the pointing resolution is adjusted to gain more accurate description of the data by MC simulation as described in Chapter~8 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}, this does not help with the vertexing which is performed at the level of raw data (MC) processing to MuDst. Another reason could be different $p_{\text{T}}$ (thus also $d_{0}$) spectrum of CEP tracks in the data and MC (GenEx).

%---------------------------

Based on the width of $|\Delta z_{0}|$ distribution, the background content as a function of $|\Delta z_{0}|$, and the value of $\mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{vtx}}$ as a function of $|\Delta z_{0}|$, we decided to accept in analysis only tracks which satisfy $|\Delta z_{0}|<2$~cm. This assures that the vertexing efficiency does not drop below $\approx 30\%$, as well as it coincides with the primary tracks requirement of $|\text{DCA}(z)|<1$~cm. In the correction procedure we nominally use the vertexing efficiency represented by open black points in Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexingEff} (to correct the MC e.g. in closure tests we use red points instead). The additional correction factor connected with the cut on maximum $|\Delta z_{0}|$ (2~cm) was calculated from the data and equals $2.4\%$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaZ0}). This correction is used as an additional normalization correction factor, which is different from $\mbox{\LARGE$\epsilon$}_{\text{vtx}}(|\Delta z_{0}|)$ applied in form of a weight to each selected CEP event.


\section{Particle energy loss}\label{sec:energyLoss}

Energy loss correction as a function of reconstructed particle $p_{\text{T}}$ in bins of $z$-position of reconstructed vertex has been calculated and presented in Chapter~5 of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote} for all analyzed particle species and both positive and negative charges. The correction was applied independetly for each particle in the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item After central particles were identified (cut~\ref{enum:CutPid}) an absolute value of the particle transverse momentum correction ($-\Delta p_{\text{T}} = p_{\text{T}}^{\text{meas}}-p_{\text{T}}^{\text{true}}$) was read from the histogram corresponding to reconstructed $z_{\text{vtx}}$ and to assigned particle ID (Appendix~C of Ref.~\cite{supplementaryNote}).
	\item The momentum correction factor $f_{p}^{\text{corr}}$ was calculated:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:pCorrFactor}
 f_{p}^{\text{corr}} = \frac{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{meas}} + \Delta p_{\text{T}}}{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{meas}}}.
  \end{equation}
  \item New, corrected momentum $\vec{p}^{corr}$ was assigned to the particle:
  \begin{equation}
   \vec{p}^{~\text{corr}} = f_{p}^{\text{corr}} \cdot \vec{p}^{~\text{meas}}.
  \end{equation}
  In this way all three components of particle momentum are corrected so that the pseudorapidity of a particle remains unchanged.
\end{enumerate}
This new momentum was further used in determination of total transverse momentum of all reconstructed particles, $p_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$, as well as in applying TPC and TOF efficiency corrections and preparing histograms (cross sections) of physics quantities (e.g. invariant mass, rapidity of a pair of central tracks).
